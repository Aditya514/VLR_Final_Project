This project is focuses on methods to improve defense of deep learning models against adverserial attacks. 

Steps to Run the code:
  1. Download and unzip the data from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i2Tl0IYcx0qNEUnry9mp78iobG7GQyhj/view?usp=sharing in the same directory as the code. 
  2. Run the 'python experiements.py' command for each of the specific experiments.
